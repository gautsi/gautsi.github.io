### 03/08/19

A had a good night sleeping yesterday: slowly went to bed after an oil massage around midnight, had a diaper change, feed, second diaper change and second feed around 5:30 before going back to sleep through the time I left for work around 8:45. He was starting to rouse as I left.

I have wanted to document in some way my and Ss experiences of As first few weeks for a number of reasons. In particular, multiple people have told us that we will forget how difficult this time has been, generally in response to our wonder at people who choose to do this again. If we choose to have a second child, I want our choice informed by this experience, and I think that perhaps if I describe it here, we can refer to this document to remember. And perhaps A will want to read it too.

As I do feel my memory fading, in the interest of documenting as much of it before it goes, I will not strain to narrate in order but rather will write on what comes to mind and hope the resulting text remains coherent.

Right now I am on a more crowded than usual E train headed home after a more crowded day than usual in Manhattan and at work. I'm thinking now of the ER visit. As first pediatrician's visit was when A was 4 days old, Jan 21 sometime around 3. Being As first trip out of the house since we brought him back from the hospital, S and I were stressed and anxious trying to prepare for all reasonably potential disasters.


We had never changed or feed him in public, and wondered how that would work though we were fairly sure that in a hopefully quick visit to the doctor we wouldn't have to be tested in those ways yet. We packed what we thought was a thorough diaper bag.

### 03/11/19

The car ride to the office went smoothly though it was my first time driving the route. Getting A ready to leave the house takes some time, between deciding what he will be wearing so he stays a comfortable temperature, dressing him in the chosen outfit, deciding who is with him as we get ready ourselves, take him down, bring the car around, get him in the car seat and the car seat in the car and timing the entire effort so that A stays calm i.e. fed and in a clean diaper at least through the trip to the destination. This day we planned well and got to the office on time.

During the appt Dr. H gave A a thorough look over and noticed the yellow in his skin, possibly an indication of jaundice. We had been told at the hospital by the pediatrician that As bilyrubin (sic) level was high, but not high enough to act on, just to monitor (if I remember correctly, bilyrubin is an enzyme that failure to process can cause yellowing in the skin and liver damage which is called jaundice). S remembered that when she was born she also had jaundice (or was jaundice risk) and was placed under blue light for treatment). It seems to be the case as S and Dr. H both pointed out that asians in particular have more yellow pigmentation in the skin and therefore are often misdiagnosed as jaundice risk at birth. Also A was not showing other signs of jaundice including yellow in the whites of the eyes and had started having yellowish poop (which I think is how the br comes out). Even with this in mind and to be safe, Dr. H looked up on the internet where As bilyrubin level at hospital discharge fell in terms of risk, and took pause when it came up high risk. He took a moment to think next steps, and decided A needed to get his bilyrubin level checked that day. Given A was high risk at discharge and continued to have yellow in his skin on the fourth day, we needed to be sure his br level was safely decreasing.

My heart rate is increasing and breathing more shallow as I type this on the train, reliving the moment when our hearts and breaths took pause at Dr. Hs words. In fact I just noticed I missed my West 4th stop and need to double back. I will leave the typing for now, focus on getting to work and pick up later.

### 03/12/18

I had a bad headache coming home from work yesterday so was pretty useless around the house but S took care of it all, including me. It was a good day for A, little crying and lots of sleeping. I feel as if it has been awhile, a week or so, since he has had a rough day (meaning crying, clinginess, cluster feeding and dirty diapers, shallow naps). Our friend T was over when I came home, we've recently started inviting friends over which has been fantastic especially for S to break the monotony, loneliness and pain of infant rearing and recovery after child birth.

To continue where I left off yesterday: when we heard from Dr. H that A needed to be tested that day, the hightened state that we had become familiar with gripped us. This is the same state I was in all day 1/17 (S was on another plane altogether) and we both were in through most of the hospital stay and on the trip home. In this state time slows and the mind focuses. I see objects more clearly. The state comes with a task of high urgency on which my thoughts and actions are preoccupied, to the exclusion of all other worries. And the eventually fading of the state once the task has resolved leaves me physically and mentally drained. I think our lives as parents will be marked by the ebb and flow of these states, and the thought of it tires me.

Dr. H also became more anxious and serious. He quickly wrote us two lab work forms (one for that day, one for a likely follow-up test in a few days) He first told us to go straight to the oot-patient lab at NYU Langonne, but as we were in the waiting room ready to leave Dr. H caught us to tell us the lab had closed already (early closing on MLK day). He wracked his brain thinking of where to send us, trying to avoid sending us to ER which would be open but with its sicknesses and illnesses would not be a safe place for a four day old. After calling the pediatrician at the NYU Langonne ER, he decided it was our best option, so off we were to the ER on As fourth day.

### 03/13/19

A had two long segments of sleep last night, about five hours from midnight to five and then about three hours until eight. A seems to be in this pattern recently, which works fine with us. A major change for us as parents: whereas before we felt we needed eight hours and annoyed if we didn't get them, now we're grateful for a quiet five. Also, A sucks his hand now with loud slurping and drooling. If it means self-soothing we are all for it, expect he usually cries for the real thing within a few minutes.

### 03/14/29

To continue the ER story: we left Dr. H's office around 5 filled with the urgency of the moment. I am not an enthusiastic driver in general. Driving is stressful for me as it seems to always require mow than the complete attention I can physically give for an extended period of time, is full of risk of bodily injury that depends as much on the behavior of strangers than my own, and I rarely feel competent at it. But As arrival has already meant multiple drives with the extra responsibility of the health of loved ones in addition to the usual stress: to the hospital with S in labor, from the hospital to bring A home, and now to the ER for an urgent test. The clarity of the hightened state has pulled us through each time.

This day was very cold, maybe the coldest of winter up to that day, and it was already dark by the time we approached NYU Langonne. I had never been to this hospital and am pretty sure S had not either so we drove slowly down the access road next to the single block-sized building that is the hospital, looking for a sign to the ER. I saw it ahead at the end of the block, after what looked to be a main entrance, maybe 500 feet in front of us. I decided to pull into the hospital parking garage immediately to our right, thinking it was a safer option than looking for parking closer to the entrance of the ER (with its risk of not finding any and having to double back) and fairly confident that there had to be an internal passage from the parking garage into the hospital and ER. There is such a passage, but as per our luck that day, it was closed. So that night was the first time we took A outside in a stroller, on a night so cold and windy my hands on the stroller hurt and the stroller shook, out of the parking garage and along the outside of the hospital to the main entrance. I walked quickly ahead with A: keep in mind through all this S was recovering from the shocking trauma of labor and birth, the prescription of bed rest out the window. Into the main entrance, I asked the people at the front desk directions to the ER. Our luck struck again: they directed us *back* outside, further along the outside of the hospital to the ER entrance at the end of the block. My comedy of errors played only in the background of my mind I as clung to the goal of the trip, namely As test.

### 03/15/19

Once finally in the ER, we were processed at the front desk and shown into room in the pediatric wing. As vitals and weight were checked and we were asked basic questions about his condition and birth. In fact we would be asked several times the exact time of his birth, 10:40 PM, as his bilyrubin levels needed to be compared against a baseline for his number of hours to acertain risk. Once initial steps were done, the ER staff left to prepare the test and we had a moment to breath and step back. We felt the strain of our anxiety wear on our bodies and minds. We began to think about what could happen next, and what we would do. If A needed to stay for treatment, where would we stay? How would we feed A, and how would we eat? Would we be allowed to stay with him in his room, or at least in the waiting room? Or should we get a hotel room nearby, and come to the ER every few hours to feed A? Perhaps I could venture out into cold night to find us food at some point. Our fatigue, helplessness and unconditional responsibility to A gave us a kind of grim resolve to make work whatever we needed to do, and survive until the hoped-for time when the danger had passed, and we were all back home again. That particular danger did pass, but at that point I surpressed the wonder that it ever would, and now I wonder if the life of a parent swings from one danger to the next.

### 03/18/19

As two month birthday was yesterday. We celebrated with a picture with a board that says "All About A, start of month 3, 3.17.19", and with the making and eating of a lemon blueberry cake that came out quite well. Our friend P had brought the cake when she visited last week and shared the recipe.

As two month birthday was yesterday. We celebrated with pictures of A with a sign that said "All About A, Start of Week Three, 3.17.19" and with the making and eating of a lemon blueberry cake that our friend P had brought over when she visited last week (or two weeks ago) and shared with us the [recipe](https://www.rhiansrecipes.com/gluten-free-vegan-lemon-blueberry-cake/).

One of As new tricks is pulling off my glasses when I get too close to his face.

At the ER, the staff had a hard time getting enough blood from As heel. They pricked him at least five times, trying to get a steady flow of blood, but all they would get were drops. The vial they had to fill seemed unreasonably large. As they squeezed As heel to draw the drops and scraped the heel with the vial to collect the blood, A screamed and cries and tried to break free. I held his legs as S tried to calm him by talking to him close to his face. I wonder now if in the tension of the momemt I held his leg too tight and restricted the flow. Once the staff finally had enough in their vials and left and A with band aids on both heels and drying blood on his feet and legs started to calm, we waited in the room, all three huddled together on the bed in the dark, for the result and the plan. It was our first moment of any peace since we were home that morning. It must have been close to 7 at that point, and we hadn't eaten since noon. S had breastfeed A twice already since we left home, once at the doctor's office and once at the ER, and we laughed about our worries that morning of breastfeeding in public.

The doctor came in after half an hour or so and told his As bilyrubin levels were high enough to monitor but not for immediate treatment. We were to come back the next day for a follow up test. When we got home we left A in the stroller sleeping near the table as we ate. We were overjoyed the next morning when our doctor called and told us that after checking the test he thought it would be better for A to get tested the next day, Wednesday 1/22. I have never been so relieved to know that I(and S and A) could stay in all day.

The test on Wednesday was done at the out patient lab at NYU Langonne and began a much calmer trip to that hospital. But when the person doing the hell prick blood draw (who was much more skilled at it then the ER staff) saw his heels we're very red and one had a yellowish patch around where the pricks were made, she told us to get it checked as it might be infected. When we got home we called our doctor who told us to come in as soon as possible, as infections can be deadly for someone as young as A whose immune system is still developing. I could not believe that our bad luck would have it that one health alarm would lead to another as we hurried to the doctor's office.

03/20/19

Yesterday was As two-month doctor's appointment. A big appointment in his vaccination schedule, this visit he got two shots (whooping cough and another I don't remember) in the thighs and a third dose by mouth (rotovirus). He cried hard immeadiately after the shots but only for a few seconds, as he was sitting in Ss lap and calmed quickly. Throughout the rest of the day he both slept deep and cried and whimpering periodically, which Dr. H said could happen. He seems to have avoided the fever and extra fussiness that Dr. H said was also a possibility and would have been more medically concerning.

His check up went mostly fine, height (23.5 in), weight (12 lbs 7 oz) and head circumference all progressing normally. Dr. H was concerned about eczema all over As body, and recommended we moisturize him multiple times a day and continue to bathe his sparingly (once or twice a week). The doctor also noticed As preference to look to his right: this could be bad for the development of both his head and neck physically and brain. We will try to stimulate A to look left more.

My sister has been staying with us for a week, is leaving today. She has tried to be helpful a little in her own halting and unsure way. I don't fault her for it, it is mostly I think a function of the person that she is right now. From our visitors it has been fairly clear for us to tell who has had the experience of a raising a baby and can understand both the stress and exhaustion that comes with the responsibility of another person's every need and the requisite menial tasks. Those who have done it before have sympathy and provide us with useful help, those who have not are taken aback.

The time before yesterday that we saw Dr. H was the infection scare. It turned out not to be, and Dr. H prescribed for A an antibiotic cream (As first prescription). The redness and yellowish patch went away after a few days of applying the cream. But what stands out most for us about that hurried visit was the great poop explosion incident of 2019. As I was removing As diaper on the inspection table for Dr. H to do a full check, he peed, as he does. As I grabbed his feet with a hand, lifted his legs and rotated him away from the pee pool to clean him, he loudly projectile pooped on and over the table, onto me, the floor, the trash can and maybe elsewhere too. In my defense, A had never done that before, so I was not expecting it (S and I would come to expect it, and try to prepare for it when we changed him but would often still be caught off guard). What followed for the next few minutes was me and S bungling to move and clean A and Dr. H scrambling to clean and disinfect the area. When Dr. H was satisfied all was clean, S asked him how often that happened. Dr. H wryly said it was usually more contained. S and I have been laughing about the moment since.

This ended the jaundice/ER/infection scare adventure of As first week (at yesterday's appointment, Dr. H officially declared the jaundice resolved). That those intense few days followed so closely on the ordeal that was Ss labor and As birth set back Ss recovery, forced us to find a deep resolve and although we were relieved the A came out of those days seemingly unscathed we braced for the next inevitable scares.

### 03/21/19

I feel a little sick today. I've had a sore throat for two days and now have added a slightly runny nose and bit of a cough. I hope it goes away soon, and A or S don't catch it. A hasn't been sick or had a fever yet as far as we know, knock on wood. I'm sure it will happen at some point, which is a scary thought at his age. But I'm confident we will deal with it as best we can as we have to this point, which seems to be working.

A laughs almost on command now. He is fascinated by S and will look at her quietly, almost studying, even when S is focused on something else entirely, say eating or talking with another person. I see much less of him now that I'm at work. I feel as if I appreciate him and my time him more. Yesterday evening I spent a good amount of time with him when I wasn't cooking, cleaning or eating, or he wasn't eating. He lied on his back on the play mat in our living room and looked at what was around, and tried directing his fist into his mouth. I lay next to him and watched, trying to keep my distance on account of my sickness. S sat next to him on his left: since the appointment on Tuesday we have done a good job of making sure we are getting him to turn to his left more, by positioning ourselves so we are to his left and sometimes also by physically turning his head and neck. He seems to be okay looking to his left though he may still prefer his right. At this point we are not too concerned.

Last night at 4 in the morning, A starting grunting and struggling against his swaddle, signs that he wanted to wake and eat and probably had a dirty diaper. I got up to attend to his diaper, and on checking saw the smallest hint of a blue line. I should know by now that such a tiny blue line sometimes such a tiny blue line means he is on the verge of a proper pee and poop, and sure enough as I pulled his diaper away he projectile pooped down the lower part of the keekaroo, onto my pants and down the side of the dresser. I jumped and yelped as I always do when he catches me off guard like that (especially because it was silent). As I grabbed some paper towels with one hand while still holding As feet and legs up and out of the poop with the other, I noticed A was now peeing on himself and outfit. I eventually got the keekaroo and A cleaned, even applying a bit of jojoba oil on his eczema before the new diaper, as A was helpfully calm throughout. He spit up as I put him in a new outfit, the stream of milk from his mouth disappearing into the folds of his neck and new outfit. After he ate, I went through my routine trying to get him to sleep, which mostly consists of me holding him up with his head on my shoulder, rocking and swaying to a steady beat, giving him a loud shhhh near his ear three beats in a row and taking a breath myself on the fourth. As he starts to calm, I try to slowly and carefully place him in the bassinet without disturbing him, though he always feels the difference in surroundings and stirs. Sometimes he will be tired enough to immediately fall back to sleep, but not this time. He continued fidgeting, fighting his swaddle and staring me down, so I rocked the bassinet and starting the shushing again. But then he gave himself the hiccups! When he finally calmed enough that I could risk going back to bed at 4:45, S and chuckled about how many of his ad our usual actions we showed during this waking: grunting and struggling against the swaddle, pee and poop on the keekaroo, oil massage, feeding, soothing and hiccupping. But when he did finally go to sleep, he gave us a good four hours. 

I think to some extent I have been avoiding writing about the event of As life to this point that towers over all other events (of his life or mine) in mind, and that is Ss labor and As birth. In large part this is because I don't think I have the words to truthfully capture that day in way that anyone else reading would understand, or that myself reading it at a later time would find accurate. In part I have avoided writing about Ss labor because I cannot imagine I will forget much anytime soon. But the feeling fades and the risk of forgetting is too distressing to consider so I will try to describe that day.

I think I have to begin with what about that day has stuck with me in the deepest way, which is that Ss physical and mental effort far surpassed any physical or mental effort I have ever seen. S was in unknown pain in waves and under unknown stress throughout from 4 in the morning through As birth at 10:40 PM, and the strength and will S had to and did expend to push A out in the last 10 minutes would have been extraordinary even if it had not been preceded by 18.5 hours of hard labor. I have known S is a uniquely strong person almost from when I first met her, but on that day I saw she was superhuman. I actually find my questioning her in my mind now whenever she says that she can't do something because I know she can. When she says she regrets her labor in that she could have done something more to make it less severe, I do not comprehend. I think in satisfaction about the rest of our lives in which I will get to see what she does next. I find myself at the end of my words on this point now. In my coming descriptions of what I saw happen on that day, you will no doubt see the evidence to back my words above and hopefully also see just how woefully inadequate those words are. I'm stopping for the day, two stops away from home on the E, to think about how to proceed with this and to look forward to a hopefully restful evening as my sickness has gotten worse (headache, runny nose).
