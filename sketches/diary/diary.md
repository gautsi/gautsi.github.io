### 03/08/19

A had a good night sleeping yesterday: slowly went to bed after an oil massage around midnight, had a diaper change, feed, second diaper change and second feed around 5:30 before going back to sleep through the time I left for work around 8:45. He was starting to rouse as I left.

I have wanted to document in some way my and Ss experiences of As first few weeks for a number of reasons. In particular, multiple people have told us that we will forget how difficult this time has been, generally in response to our wonder at people who choose to do this again. If we choose to have a second child, I want our choice informed by this experience, and I think that perhaps if I describe it here, we can refer to this document to remember. And perhaps A will want to read it too.

As I do feel my memory fading, in the interest of documenting as much of it before it goes, I will not strain to narrate in order but rather will write on what comes to mind and hope the resulting text remains coherent.

Right now I am on a more crowded than usual E train headed home after a more crowded day than usual in Manhattan and at work. I'm thinking now of the ER visit. As first pediatrician's visit was when A was 4 days old, Jan 21 sometime around 3. Being As first trip out of the house since we brought him back from the hospital, S and I were stressed and anxious trying to prepare for all reasonably potential disasters.


We had never changed or feed him in public, and wondered how that would work though we were fairly sure that in a hopefully quick visit to the doctor we wouldn't have to be tested in those ways yet. We packed what we thought was a thorough diaper bag.

The car ride to the office went smoothly though it was my first time driving the route. Getting A ready to leave the house takes some time, between deciding what he will be wearing so he stays a comfortable temperature, dressing him in the chosen outfit, deciding who is with him as we get ready ourselves, take him down, bring the car around, get him in the car seat and the car seat in the car and timing the entire effort so that A stays calm i.e. fed and in a clean diaper at least through the trip to the destination. This day we planned well and got to the office on time. 

During the appt Dr. H gave A a thorough look over and noticed the yellow in his skin, possibly an indication of jaundice. We had been told at the hospital by the pediatrician that As bilyrubin (sic) level was high, but not high enough to act on, just to monitor (if I remember correctly, bilyrubin is an enzyme that failure to process can cause yellowing in the skin and liver damage which is called jaundice). S remembered that when she was born she also had jaundice (or was jaundice risk) and was placed under blue light for treatment). It seems to be the case as S and Dr. H both pointed out that asians in particular have more yellow pigmentation in the skin and therefore are often misdiagnosed as jaundice risk at birth. Also A was not showing other signs of jaundice including yellow in the whites of the eyes and had started having yellowish poop (which I think is how the br comes out). Even with this in mind and to be safe, Dr. H looked up on the internet where As bilyrubin level at hospital discharge fell in terms of risk, and took pause when it came up high risk. He took a moment to think next steps, and decided A needed to get his bilyrubin level checked that day. Given A was high risk at discharge and continued to have yellow in his skin on the fourth day, we needed to be sure his br level was safely decreasing.

My heart rate is increasing and breathing more shallow as I type this on the train, reliving the moment when our hearts and breaths took pause at Dr. Hs words. In fact I just noticed I missed my West 4th stop and need to double back. I will leave the typing for now, focus on getting to work and pick up later
