### 03/08/19

A had a good night sleeping yesterday: slowly went to bed after an oil massage around midnight, had a diaper change, feed, second diaper change and second feed around 5:30 before going back to sleep through the time I left for work around 8:45. He was starting to rouse as I left.

I have wanted to document in some way my and Ss experiences of As first few weeks for a number of reasons. In particular, multiple people have told us that we will forget how difficult this time has been, generally in response to our wonder at people who choose to do this again. If we choose to have a second child, I want our choice informed by this experience, and I think that perhaps if I describe it here, we can refer to this document to remember. And perhaps A will want to read it too.

As I do feel my memory fading, in the interest of documenting as much of it before it goes, I will not strain to narrate in order but rather will write on what comes to mind and hope the resulting text remains coherent.

Right now I am on a more crowded than usual E train headed home after a more crowded day than usual in Manhattan and at work. I'm thinking now of the ER visit. As first pediatrician's visit was when A was 4 days old, Jan 21 sometime around 3. Being As first trip out of the house since we brought him back from the hospital, S and I were stressed and anxious trying to prepare for all reasonably potential disasters.


We had never changed or feed him in public, and wondered how that would work though we were fairly sure that in a hopefully quick visit to the doctor we wouldn't have to be tested in those ways yet. We packed what we thought was a thorough diaper bag.

### 03/11/19

The car ride to the office went smoothly though it was my first time driving the route. Getting A ready to leave the house takes some time, between deciding what he will be wearing so he stays a comfortable temperature, dressing him in the chosen outfit, deciding who is with him as we get ready ourselves, take him down, bring the car around, get him in the car seat and the car seat in the car and timing the entire effort so that A stays calm i.e. fed and in a clean diaper at least through the trip to the destination. This day we planned well and got to the office on time. 

During the appt Dr. H gave A a thorough look over and noticed the yellow in his skin, possibly an indication of jaundice. We had been told at the hospital by the pediatrician that As bilyrubin (sic) level was high, but not high enough to act on, just to monitor (if I remember correctly, bilyrubin is an enzyme that failure to process can cause yellowing in the skin and liver damage which is called jaundice). S remembered that when she was born she also had jaundice (or was jaundice risk) and was placed under blue light for treatment). It seems to be the case as S and Dr. H both pointed out that asians in particular have more yellow pigmentation in the skin and therefore are often misdiagnosed as jaundice risk at birth. Also A was not showing other signs of jaundice including yellow in the whites of the eyes and had started having yellowish poop (which I think is how the br comes out). Even with this in mind and to be safe, Dr. H looked up on the internet where As bilyrubin level at hospital discharge fell in terms of risk, and took pause when it came up high risk. He took a moment to think next steps, and decided A needed to get his bilyrubin level checked that day. Given A was high risk at discharge and continued to have yellow in his skin on the fourth day, we needed to be sure his br level was safely decreasing.

My heart rate is increasing and breathing more shallow as I type this on the train, reliving the moment when our hearts and breaths took pause at Dr. Hs words. In fact I just noticed I missed my West 4th stop and need to double back. I will leave the typing for now, focus on getting to work and pick up later.

I had a bad headache coming home from work yesterday so was pretty useless around the house but S took care of it all, including me. It was a good day for A, little crying and lots of sleeping. I feel as if it has been awhile, a week or so, since he has had a rough day (meaning crying, clinginess, cluster feeding and dirty diapers, shallow naps). Our friend T was over when I came home, we've recently started inviting friends over which has been fantastic especially for S to break the monotony, loneliness and pain of infant rearing and recovery after child birth.

To continue where I left off yesterday: when we heard from Dr. H that A needed to be tested that day, the hightened state that we had become familiar with gripped us. This is the same state I was in all day 1/17 (S was on another plane altogether) and we both were in through most of the hospital stay and on the trip home. In this state time slows and the mind focuses. I see objects more clearly. The state comes with a task of high urgency on which my thoughts and actions are preoccupied, to the exclusion of all other worries. And the eventually fading of the state once the task has resolved leaves me physically and mentally drained. I think our lives as parents will be marked by the ebb and flow of these states, and the thought of it tires me.

Dr. H also became more anxious and serious. He quickly wrote us two lab work forms (one for that day, one for a likely follow-up test in a few days) He first told us to go straight to the oot-patient lab at NYU Langonne, but as we were in the waiting room ready to leave Dr. H caught us to tell us the lab had closed already (early closing on MLK day). He wracked his brain thinking of where to send us, trying to avoid sending us to ER which would be open but with its sicknesses and illnesses would not be a safe place for a four day old. After calling the pediatrician at the NYU Langonne ER, he decided it was our best option, so off we were to the ER on As fourth day.

### 03/13/19

A had two long segments of sleep last night, about five hours from midnight to five and then about three hours until eight. A seems to be in this pattern recently, which works fine with us. A major change for us as parents: whereas before we felt we needed eight hours and annoyed if we didn't get them, now we're grateful for a quiet five. Also, A sucks his hand now with loud slurping and drooling. If it means self-soothing we are all for it, expect he usually cries for the real thing within a few minutes.

### 03/14/29

To continue the ER story: we left Dr. H's office around 5 filled with the urgency of the moment. I am not an enthusiastic driver in general. Driving is stressful for me as it seems to always require mow than the complete attention I can physically give for an extended period of time, is full of risk of bodily injury that depends as much on the behavior of strangers than my own, and I rarely feel competent at it. But As arrival has already meant multiple drives with the extra responsibility of the health of loved ones in addition to the usual stress: to the hospital with S in labor, from the hospital to bring A home, and now to the ER for an urgent test. The clarity of the hightened state has pulled us through each time.

This day was very cold, maybe the coldest of winter up to that day, and it was already dark by the time we approached NYU Langonne. I had never been to this hospital and am pretty sure S had not either so we drove slowly down the access road next to the single block-sized building that is the hospital, looking for a sign to the ER. I saw it ahead at the end of the block, after what looked to be a main entrance, maybe 500 feet in front of us. I decided to pull into the hospital parking garage immediately to our right, thinking it was a safer option than looking for parking closer to the entrance of the ER (with its risk of not finding any and having to double back) and fairly confident that there had to be an internal passage from the parking garage into the hospital and ER. There is such a passage, but as per our luck that day, it was closed. So that night was the first time we took A outside in a stroller, on a night so cold and windy my hands on the stroller hurt and the stroller shook, out of the parking garage and along the outside of the hospital to the main entrance. I walked quickly ahead with A: keep in mind through all this S was recovering from the shocking trauma of labor and birth, the prescription of bed rest out the window. Into the main entrance, I asked the people at the front desk directions to the ER. Our luck struck again: they directed us *back* outside, further along the outside of the hospital to the ER entrance at the end of the block. My comedy of errors played only in the background of my mind I as clung to the goal of the trip, namely As test.

Once finally in the ER, we were processed at the front desk and shown into room in the pediatric wing. As vitals and weight were checked and we were asked basic questions about his condition and birth. In fact we would be asked several times the exact time of his birth, 10:40 PM, as his bilyrubin levels needed to be compared against a baseline for his number of hours to acertain risk. Once initial steps were done, the ER staff left to prepare the test and we had a moment to breath and step back. We felt the strain of our anxiety wear on our bodies and minds. We began to think about what could happen next, and what we would do. If A needed to stay for treatment, where would we stay? How would we feed A, and how would we eat? Would we be allowed to stay with him in his room, or at least in the waiting room? Or should we get a hotel room nearby, and come to the ER every few hours to feed A? Perhaps I could venture out into cold night to find us food at some point. Our fatigue, helplessness and unconditional responsibility to A gave us a kind of grim resolve to make work whatever we needed to do, and survive until the hoped-for time when the danger had passed, and we were all back home again. That particular danger did pass, but at that point I surpressed the wonder that it ever would, and now I wonder if the life of a parent swings from one danger to the next.

As two month birthday was yesterday. We celebrated with a picture with a board that says "All About A, start of month 3, 3.17.19", and with the making and eating of a lemon blueberry cake that came out quite well. Our friend P had brought the cake when she visited last week and shared the recipe.

One of As new tricks is pulling off my glasses when I get too close to his face
