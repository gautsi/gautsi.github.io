### 03/08/19

A had a good night sleeping yesterday: slowly went to bed after an oil massage around midnight, had a diaper change, feed, second diaper change and second feed around 5:30 before going back to sleep through the time I left for work around 8:45. He was starting to rouse as I left.

I have wanted to document in some way my and Ss experiences of As first few weeks for a number of reasons. In particular, multiple people have told us that we will forget how difficult this time has been, generally in response to our wonder at people who choose to do this again. If we choose to have a second child, I want our choice informed by this experience, and I think that perhaps if I describe it here, we can refer to this document to remember. And perhaps A will want to read it too.

As I do feel my memory fading, in the interest of documenting as much of it before it goes, I will not strain to narrate in order but rather will write on what comes to mind and hope the resulting text remains coherent.

Right now I am on a more crowded than usual E train headed home after a more crowded day than usual in Manhattan and at work. I'm thinking now of the ER visit. As first pediatrician's visit was when A was 4 days old, Jan 21 sometime around 3. Being As first trip out of the house since we brought him back from the hospital, S and I were stressed and anxious trying to prepare for all reasonably potential disasters.


We had never changed or feed him in public, and wondered how that would work though we were fairly sure that in a hopefully quick visit to the doctor we wouldn't have to be tested in those ways yet. We packed what we thought was a thorough diaper bag.

### 03/11/19

The car ride to the office went smoothly though it was my first time driving the route. Getting A ready to leave the house takes some time, between deciding what he will be wearing so he stays a comfortable temperature, dressing him in the chosen outfit, deciding who is with him as we get ready ourselves, take him down, bring the car around, get him in the car seat and the car seat in the car and timing the entire effort so that A stays calm i.e. fed and in a clean diaper at least through the trip to the destination. This day we planned well and got to the office on time.

During the appt Dr. H gave A a thorough look over and noticed the yellow in his skin, possibly an indication of jaundice. We had been told at the hospital by the pediatrician that As bilyrubin (sic) level was high, but not high enough to act on, just to monitor (if I remember correctly, bilyrubin is an enzyme that failure to process can cause yellowing in the skin and liver damage which is called jaundice). S remembered that when she was born she also had jaundice (or was jaundice risk) and was placed under blue light for treatment). It seems to be the case as S and Dr. H both pointed out that asians in particular have more yellow pigmentation in the skin and therefore are often misdiagnosed as jaundice risk at birth. Also A was not showing other signs of jaundice including yellow in the whites of the eyes and had started having yellowish poop (which I think is how the br comes out). Even with this in mind and to be safe, Dr. H looked up on the internet where As bilyrubin level at hospital discharge fell in terms of risk, and took pause when it came up high risk. He took a moment to think next steps, and decided A needed to get his bilyrubin level checked that day. Given A was high risk at discharge and continued to have yellow in his skin on the fourth day, we needed to be sure his br level was safely decreasing.

My heart rate is increasing and breathing more shallow as I type this on the train, reliving the moment when our hearts and breaths took pause at Dr. Hs words. In fact I just noticed I missed my West 4th stop and need to double back. I will leave the typing for now, focus on getting to work and pick up later.

### 03/12/18

I had a bad headache coming home from work yesterday so was pretty useless around the house but S took care of it all, including me. It was a good day for A, little crying and lots of sleeping. I feel as if it has been awhile, a week or so, since he has had a rough day (meaning crying, clinginess, cluster feeding and dirty diapers, shallow naps). Our friend T was over when I came home, we've recently started inviting friends over which has been fantastic especially for S to break the monotony, loneliness and pain of infant rearing and recovery after child birth.

To continue where I left off yesterday: when we heard from Dr. H that A needed to be tested that day, the hightened state that we had become familiar with gripped us. This is the same state I was in all day 1/17 (S was on another plane altogether) and we both were in through most of the hospital stay and on the trip home. In this state time slows and the mind focuses. I see objects more clearly. The state comes with a task of high urgency on which my thoughts and actions are preoccupied, to the exclusion of all other worries. And the eventually fading of the state once the task has resolved leaves me physically and mentally drained. I think our lives as parents will be marked by the ebb and flow of these states, and the thought of it tires me.

Dr. H also became more anxious and serious. He quickly wrote us two lab work forms (one for that day, one for a likely follow-up test in a few days) He first told us to go straight to the oot-patient lab at NYU Langonne, but as we were in the waiting room ready to leave Dr. H caught us to tell us the lab had closed already (early closing on MLK day). He wracked his brain thinking of where to send us, trying to avoid sending us to ER which would be open but with its sicknesses and illnesses would not be a safe place for a four day old. After calling the pediatrician at the NYU Langonne ER, he decided it was our best option, so off we were to the ER on As fourth day.

### 03/13/19

A had two long segments of sleep last night, about five hours from midnight to five and then about three hours until eight. A seems to be in this pattern recently, which works fine with us. A major change for us as parents: whereas before we felt we needed eight hours and annoyed if we didn't get them, now we're grateful for a quiet five. Also, A sucks his hand now with loud slurping and drooling. If it means self-soothing we are all for it, expect he usually cries for the real thing within a few minutes.

### 03/14/29

To continue the ER story: we left Dr. H's office around 5 filled with the urgency of the moment. I am not an enthusiastic driver in general. Driving is stressful for me as it seems to always require mow than the complete attention I can physically give for an extended period of time, is full of risk of bodily injury that depends as much on the behavior of strangers than my own, and I rarely feel competent at it. But As arrival has already meant multiple drives with the extra responsibility of the health of loved ones in addition to the usual stress: to the hospital with S in labor, from the hospital to bring A home, and now to the ER for an urgent test. The clarity of the hightened state has pulled us through each time.

This day was very cold, maybe the coldest of winter up to that day, and it was already dark by the time we approached NYU Langonne. I had never been to this hospital and am pretty sure S had not either so we drove slowly down the access road next to the single block-sized building that is the hospital, looking for a sign to the ER. I saw it ahead at the end of the block, after what looked to be a main entrance, maybe 500 feet in front of us. I decided to pull into the hospital parking garage immediately to our right, thinking it was a safer option than looking for parking closer to the entrance of the ER (with its risk of not finding any and having to double back) and fairly confident that there had to be an internal passage from the parking garage into the hospital and ER. There is such a passage, but as per our luck that day, it was closed. So that night was the first time we took A outside in a stroller, on a night so cold and windy my hands on the stroller hurt and the stroller shook, out of the parking garage and along the outside of the hospital to the main entrance. I walked quickly ahead with A: keep in mind through all this S was recovering from the shocking trauma of labor and birth, the prescription of bed rest out the window. Into the main entrance, I asked the people at the front desk directions to the ER. Our luck struck again: they directed us *back* outside, further along the outside of the hospital to the ER entrance at the end of the block. My comedy of errors played only in the background of my mind I as clung to the goal of the trip, namely As test.

### 03/15/19

Once finally in the ER, we were processed at the front desk and shown into room in the pediatric wing. As vitals and weight were checked and we were asked basic questions about his condition and birth. In fact we would be asked several times the exact time of his birth, 10:40 PM, as his bilyrubin levels needed to be compared against a baseline for his number of hours to acertain risk. Once initial steps were done, the ER staff left to prepare the test and we had a moment to breath and step back. We felt the strain of our anxiety wear on our bodies and minds. We began to think about what could happen next, and what we would do. If A needed to stay for treatment, where would we stay? How would we feed A, and how would we eat? Would we be allowed to stay with him in his room, or at least in the waiting room? Or should we get a hotel room nearby, and come to the ER every few hours to feed A? Perhaps I could venture out into cold night to find us food at some point. Our fatigue, helplessness and unconditional responsibility to A gave us a kind of grim resolve to make work whatever we needed to do, and survive until the hoped-for time when the danger had passed, and we were all back home again. That particular danger did pass, but at that point I surpressed the wonder that it ever would, and now I wonder if the life of a parent swings from one danger to the next.

### 03/18/19

As two month birthday was yesterday. We celebrated with a picture with a board that says "All About A, start of month 3, 3.17.19", and with the making and eating of a lemon blueberry cake that came out quite well. Our friend P had brought the cake when she visited last week and shared the recipe.

### 03/18/19

As two month birthday was yesterday. We celebrated with pictures of A with a sign that said "All About A, Start of Week Three, 3.17.19" and with the making and eating of a lemon blueberry cake that our friend P had brought over when she visited last week (or two weeks ago) and shared with us the [recipe](https://www.rhiansrecipes.com/gluten-free-vegan-lemon-blueberry-cake/).

One of As new tricks is pulling off my glasses when I get too close to his face.

At the ER, the staff had a hard time getting enough blood from As heel. They pricked him at least five times, trying to get a steady flow of blood, but all they would get were drops. The vial they had to fill seemed unreasonably large. As they squeezed As heel to draw the drops and scraped the heel with the vial to collect the blood, A screamed and cries and tried to break free. I held his legs as S tried to calm him by talking to him close to his face. I wonder now if in the tension of the momemt I held his leg too tight and restricted the flow. Once the staff finally had enough in their vials and left and A with band aids on both heels and drying blood on his feet and legs started to calm, we waited in the room, all three huddled together on the bed in the dark, for the result and the plan. It was our first moment of any peace since we were home that morning. It must have been close to 7 at that point, and we hadn't eaten since noon. S had breastfeed A twice already since we left home, once at the doctor's office and once at the ER, and we laughed about our worries that morning of breastfeeding in public.

The doctor came in after half an hour or so and told his As bilyrubin levels were high enough to monitor but not for immediate treatment. We were to come back the next day for a follow up test. When we got home we left A in the stroller sleeping near the table as we ate. We were overjoyed the next morning when our doctor called and told us that after checking the test he thought it would be better for A to get tested the next day, Wednesday 1/22. I have never been so relieved to know that I(and S and A) could stay in all day.

The test on Wednesday was done at the out patient lab at NYU Langonne and began a much calmer trip to that hospital. But when the person doing the hell prick blood draw (who was much more skilled at it then the ER staff) saw his heels we're very red and one had a yellowish patch around where the pricks were made, she told us to get it checked as it might be infected. When we got home we called our doctor who told us to come in as soon as possible, as infections can be deadly for someone as young as A whose immune system is still developing. I could not believe that our bad luck would have it that one health alarm would lead to another as we hurried to the doctor's office.

03/20/19

Yesterday was As two-month doctor's appointment. A big appointment in his vaccination schedule, this visit he got two shots (whooping cough and another I don't remember) in the thighs and a third dose by mouth (rotovirus). He cried hard immeadiately after the shots but only for a few seconds, as he was sitting in Ss lap and calmed quickly. Throughout the rest of the day he both slept deep and cried and whimpering periodically, which Dr. H said could happen. He seems to have avoided the fever and extra fussiness that Dr. H said was also a possibility and would have been more medically concerning.

His check up went mostly fine, height (23.5 in), weight (12 lbs 7 oz) and head circumference all progressing normally. Dr. H was concerned about eczema all over As body, and recommended we moisturize him multiple times a day and continue to bathe his sparingly (once or twice a week). The doctor also noticed As preference to look to his right: this could be bad for the development of both his head and neck physically and brain. We will try to stimulate A to look left more.

My sister has been staying with us for a week, is leaving today. She has tried to be helpful a little in her own halting and unsure way. I don't fault her for it, it is mostly I think a function of the person that she is right now. From our visitors it has been fairly clear for us to tell who has had the experience of a raising a baby and can understand both the stress and exhaustion that comes with the responsibility of another person's every need and the requisite menial tasks. Those who have done it before have sympathy and provide us with useful help, those who have not are taken aback.

The time before yesterday that we saw Dr. H was the infection scare. It turned out not to be, and Dr. H prescribed for A an antibiotic cream (As first prescription). The redness and yellowish patch went away after a few days of applying the cream. But what stands out most for us about that hurried visit was the great poop explosion incident of 2019. As I was removing As diaper on the inspection table for Dr. H to do a full check, he peed, as he does. As I grabbed his feet with a hand, lifted his legs and rotated him away from the pee pool to clean him, he loudly projectile pooped on and over the table, onto me, the floor, the trash can and maybe elsewhere too. In my defense, A had never done that before, so I was not expecting it (S and I would come to expect it, and try to prepare for it when we changed him but would often still be caught off guard). What followed for the next few minutes was me and S bungling to move and clean A and Dr. H scrambling to clean and disinfect the area. When Dr. H was satisfied all was clean, S asked him how often that happened. Dr. H wryly said it was usually more contained. S and I have been laughing about the moment since.

This ended the jaundice/ER/infection scare adventure of As first week (at yesterday's appointment, Dr. H officially declared the jaundice resolved). That those intense few days followed so closely on the ordeal that was Ss labor and As birth set back Ss recovery, forced us to find a deep resolve and although we were relieved the A came out of those days seemingly unscathed we braced for the next inevitable scares.

### 03/21/19

I feel a little sick today. I've had a sore throat for two days and now have added a slightly runny nose and bit of a cough. I hope it goes away soon, and A or S don't catch it. A hasn't been sick or had a fever yet as far as we know, knock on wood. I'm sure it will happen at some point, which is a scary thought at his age. But I'm confident we will deal with it as best we can as we have to this point, which seems to be working.

A laughs almost on command now. He is fascinated by S and will look at her quietly, almost studying, even when S is focused on something else entirely, say eating or talking with another person. I see much less of him now that I'm at work. I feel as if I appreciate him and my time him more. Yesterday evening I spent a good amount of time with him when I wasn't cooking, cleaning or eating, or he wasn't eating. He lied on his back on the play mat in our living room and looked at what was around, and tried directing his fist into his mouth. I lay next to him and watched, trying to keep my distance on account of my sickness. S sat next to him on his left: since the appointment on Tuesday we have done a good job of making sure we are getting him to turn to his left more, by positioning ourselves so we are to his left and sometimes also by physically turning his head and neck. He seems to be okay looking to his left though he may still prefer his right. At this point we are not too concerned.

Last night at 4 in the morning, A starting grunting and struggling against his swaddle, signs that he wanted to wake and eat and probably had a dirty diaper. I got up to attend to his diaper, and on checking saw the smallest hint of a blue line. I should know by now that such a tiny blue line sometimes such a tiny blue line means he is on the verge of a proper pee and poop, and sure enough as I pulled his diaper away he projectile pooped down the lower part of the keekaroo, onto my pants and down the side of the dresser. I jumped and yelped as I always do when he catches me off guard like that (especially because it was silent). As I grabbed some paper towels with one hand while still holding As feet and legs up and out of the poop with the other, I noticed A was now peeing on himself and outfit. I eventually got the keekaroo and A cleaned, even applying a bit of jojoba oil on his eczema before the new diaper, as A was helpfully calm throughout. He spit up as I put him in a new outfit, the stream of milk from his mouth disappearing into the folds of his neck and new outfit. After he ate, I went through my routine trying to get him to sleep, which mostly consists of me holding him up with his head on my shoulder, rocking and swaying to a steady beat, giving him a loud shhhh near his ear three beats in a row and taking a breath myself on the fourth. As he starts to calm, I try to slowly and carefully place him in the bassinet without disturbing him, though he always feels the difference in surroundings and stirs. Sometimes he will be tired enough to immediately fall back to sleep, but not this time. He continued fidgeting, fighting his swaddle and staring me down, so I rocked the bassinet and starting the shushing again. But then he gave himself the hiccups! When he finally calmed enough that I could risk going back to bed at 4:45, S and chuckled about how many of his ad our usual actions we showed during this waking: grunting and struggling against the swaddle, pee and poop on the keekaroo, oil massage, feeding, soothing and hiccupping. But when he did finally go to sleep, he gave us a good four hours. 

I think to some extent I have been avoiding writing about the event of As life to this point that towers over all other events (of his life or mine) in mind, and that is Ss labor and As birth. In large part this is because I don't think I have the words to truthfully capture that day in way that anyone else reading would understand, or that myself reading it at a later time would find accurate. In part I have avoided writing about Ss labor because I cannot imagine I will forget much anytime soon. But the feeling fades and the risk of forgetting is too distressing to consider so I will try to describe that day.

I think I have to begin with what about that day has stuck with me in the deepest way, which is that Ss physical and mental effort far surpassed any physical or mental effort I have ever seen. S was in unknown pain in waves and under unknown stress throughout from 4 in the morning through As birth at 10:40 PM, and the strength and will S had to and did expend to push A out in the last 10 minutes would have been extraordinary even if it had not been preceded by 18.5 hours of hard labor. I have known S is a uniquely strong person almost from when I first met her, but on that day I saw she was superhuman. I actually find my questioning her in my mind now whenever she says that she can't do something because I know she can. When she says she regrets her labor in that she could have done something more to make it less severe, I do not comprehend. I think in satisfaction about the rest of our lives in which I will get to see what she does next. I find myself at the end of my words on this point now. In my coming descriptions of what I saw happen on that day, you will no doubt see the evidence to back my words above and hopefully also see just how woefully inadequate those words are. I'm stopping for the day, two stops away from home on the E, to think about how to proceed with this and to look forward to a hopefully restful evening as my sickness has gotten worse (headache, runny nose).

### 03/27/19

A had a relatively rough night yesterday. The longest stretch he gave us was about 3 hours between 1 and 4 in the morning. He screamed and shouted loudly whenever he was on the changing table and would only stop when he started feeding immediately after being changed. Soothing him after feeding to get him to sleep took much longer than usual, and he fought hard against the swaddle, a few times getting his arms out. One thing this means is I'm tired standing on this train to work, my head feeling foggy and loopy. S and I were terse with each other this morning and much of last night, and I could tell she was feeling down as I left, but I didn't say anything. I feel terrible that I didn't.


When A screams, a strange thing happens in my mind. I focus on what I think needs to be done to get him to stop screaming, which is usually to finish changing him quickly so he can start feeding. But at the same time my thoughts leave the room and wander around my insecurities. In those times I don't feel like I have the mental constitution to be a good parent. I am annoyed by A too quickly, I don't have the patience to understand that his screams are temporary, I don't love him enough to be gentle. I spend much time thinking about my coding projects or work, theoretical things and ideas. I want to work on those things, and try to steal time when I can to do so. The thrill of discovery and creation that comes from writing a working program that substantiates my ideas invigorates and excites me. But when A is screaming, I feel that my urges towards working on my own stuff come at the expense of a good parent's mindset. A's basic well-being requires about as much effort as I can give after a long work day. His proper development asks of us even more time and attention. I struggle with my strong sense that the mind and soul of the current person that I am are not principled for good parenthood.

I'm on the train home now at 5:30, feeling better about myself as a parent. Part of it is having a decent day at work, part of it is the distance from this morning, forgiving myself and mind and probably some forgetting of the hard parts as well. I will try to pick up the labor story.

I remember S waking me in pain between 4 and 5 in the morning of January 17, 2019. As the pain would come and go periodically, we thought they might be contractions. We looked up signs of contractions on the internet and our copy of The Birth Partner book, and convinced ourselves they were contractions. What we had learned in our birthing class and I had read in the book started coming to mind. We weren't panicked as we knew the early phases of labor can take a long time, potentially hours. We tried distracting S with the TV show The Office, but halfway through the first episode S felt a contractions painful enough that she couldn't concentrate on the show. From what I had read about labor, I was expecting this point past distraction would happen later, say by half an hour or so, and began to feel the excitement and apprehension of impending labor. S was in such pain during the contractions that she would curl up fully concentrated on the wave of pain, shouting and screaming and moaning, trying to get to the end of the wave.

But even in the lull between contractions S was in pain, mostly in the pelvis and would scream for counter pressure at her hips as soon as the contraction was gone. I scrambled to remember the techniques we learned on class, from J our doula and from books. Soon we developed a rythm: when S felt the contraction coming, she would bend over the bed, head in her folded arms and I would stand behind her, bracing myself with bent knees. As the contraction came S would shout every few ten seconds or so and push her weight against me behind her. I would try to return her effort, keeping both of us stable though I thought a few times that S would bowl me over. As the contraction left S would feel the sharpest pain and would scream, me pushing against her butt and hips to try to give some comfort. When the sharp pain left we had a moment to catch our breaths and talk about our plan for the next contraction soon to come. I was at the same time trying to time the contractions as we were told to wait for 3-1-1 (3 minutes between contractions, 1 minute long contractions, for 1 hour) before heading to the hospital. When I remembered I would start the timer on the contraction timer app I had gotten for this specific purpose when S said the contraction was coming and stopped the timer when S said or I felt the contraction had left. But keeping an accurate accounting was difficult because S saying her contraction was coming meant she needed me in position then, and she needed me in position when the contraction ended to help her deal with the sharpest pain. So I kept record of timings as best I could, knowing how important it was to get an idea of how far labor had progressed, but caring for S in the moment was the higher priority for me.

After about an hour of our rythym S was in much discomfort, our plans stopped working to help her handle the pain and she needed a change of environment. S decided she wanted to try getting in the shower, as we had learned that water can help calm the body during labor and S finds showers relaxing. The shower did help for a few contractions though I was extra concerned about getting a good grip from the wet shower floor when she used me for counter pressure. For the next few hours we would periodically switch between the bathroom and bedroom. S threw up a couple of times, in the bathroom sink and bedroom floor. I had made dal and some saq the dinner before, and we saw it come out. As it turned out, S would not eat the whole day.

## 04/02/19

Yesterday S went into work for about four hours so I stayed home with A (it was a Monday). The first almost hour went well, A was just sleeping in the green floor lounger while I did a bit of work stuff and my own side project. But then A woke up crying, and I checked his diaper (clean) and tried feeding him from the bottle (S had pumped that morning and we had left four ounces in the comotomo). A has until now taken to the bottle and drinks from it without much fuss, but yesterday he didn't want it. He would cry with his mouth wide open and the bottle nipple in his mouth, or he would take one suck and then fuss, or would just play with the nipple with his tongue. I would try putting the bottle away, thinking he wasn't hungry but that would just make him cry louder. I tried different ways of holding him in my lap, feeding him while he was on the floor lounger, even trying to feed him while he was in the carrier strapped to me, but he ever fed calmly. At one point I tried squirting the milk into his mouth, which just made him more upset. He did somehow drink three of the four ounces over the four hours S was away but I think in tiny amounts over the many times I tried feeding him. After a few hours of everything I tried annoying him more and more to louder and louder crying, he fell asleep in the swing after a diaper change and cocunut oil massage. S came home to A sleeping in the swing, me working on my coding project on the table next to him.

A's crying disturbs me deeply. He does nothing with abandon, his every action is completely and to the fullest extent what he wants to do in that moment. It's beautiful watching him yawn with his whole head, or curl his body while chuckling when something amuses him, or contort himself to stare at whatever object has caught his interest. I wonder when he will learn inhibition, and I hope not for a while and only enough to make him a decent person. But his lack of inhibition also means that his progression of cries can reach such a volume and intensity that they pierce the mind, crowding out any thought not about the crying.

I get angry at A when he cries at his loudest, without reason because he can't really help crying. I tell myself that crying is just his way of communicating to calm myself down. But I also get angry at myself for not being kinder to him. My parents used to get angry with me enough to hit me when I was a child and although I would never hit A I do feel where the inclination starts from inside me when he cries. In these moments I reconsider my idea that I am a good kind person. I wonder if I should even be a dad, if I have the mental and moral fortitude and composition for it. I even think about times in the past when I have hurt people, when I was a bully in elementary school and how I have tried to be a kinder person by acting and talking carefully to and around other people. Perhaps A's crying chips at my constructed veneer and reveals deep unresolved cruel tendencies.

## 04/03/19

Where I had left off in the labor story, S was having contractions at home and we were trying to manage them with different positions, counter pressures and showers. We kept our doula and midwives updated with calls every half hour or so. S was being brave but I thought the contractions were starting to wear her down, and even in the short intervals between the pain and intensity she was bracing herself for the next wave. Eventually we asked our doula to come over and when she did arrive she took over the counter pressure responsibility from me which was a great help for S as she was much better at it than me. S was screaming her lungs out during the contractions, later she would wonder why the neighbors didn't call the police. The doula also freed me up to take better time measurements of the contractions, and we were close to 3-1-1 when we collectively along with the midwife J to head to the hospital and plan to be there at 1:30.

The weight of the situation threatened to overtake my sense on the drive to the hospital. I am generally not a confident or enthusiastic driver even in the most normal of circumstances, but here S was having painful contractions in the back seat. But my mind had entered a calmness, perhaps precipitated by the weight of the situation, that kept me functioning. It also helped to have the doula in the back seat with S, applying counter pressure and walking S through breathing techniques, which meant I could concentrate fully on the road, the other vehicles around us and the directions. I smile when I think about S giving directions from the back seat in between contractions, telling me to slow down and where to turn. The doula laughed in amazement at her clarity in the middle of labor. The drive took about 45 minutes.

We reached the hospital (Mt. Sinai West) at 1:30, left the car for hospital valet and made our way to labor and delivery triage, me supporting S on one side, the doula on the other.

## 04/05/19

A's dry skin is much better on his chest and legs but worse on his forehead. Yesterday it was striped by bright red wet open scratches, wrenchingly pitiful sight. We have been moisturizing his body and head four to five times a day with coconut and jojoba oil (and a couple of times with vanicream) and I think they are helping but as I know from my own battles with eczema, skin conditions can be quick to show up but painfully slow to leave. For about week now he has been keeping his hands on and around his face more often, I naively thought he was just exploring his face with touch but now believe he has been scratching. We kept him in a swaddle for much of the evening to keep him from scratching and covered his forehead with a hat. He now regularly breaks out of the piece-of-cloth swaddle I wrap around him during the night so we use more often a swaddle that S's brother N gave us which has snap button. Harder for him to completely break out of but he did get his hands free last night. A is strong and relentless.

We know his nails are usually sharp, and perhaps if we cut them he wouldn't scratch himself open, but cutting his nails is not for the faint of heart because they are small, much smaller than even the small baby nail cutter we got exactly for this purpose. With the amount he squirms one person has to fold a finger tightly as the other carefully takes tiny pieces of the nail off. Sometime we use a nail file, which doesn't shorten the nails but does I think help make them softer.

A wants to scratch his forehead and struggles against all of our attempts to keep him from doing so. It must feel like torture for him to have an itchy face and forehead and not be able to scratch, and not know as we do that scratching will make it worse. By this morning his scratches had scabbed, hopefully the skin will heal today take to our oil massage regimen.

## 04/08/19

A's skin has improved and softened. The scratches on his forehead are now small scabs and he seems to be less interested in scratching. This weekend we were pretty aggressive with applying coconut oil, a balm that friend gave us for dry skin and hydrocortisone cream to A's forehead, chest and legs almost whenever he needed a diaper change, which I think helped. But I feel my eczema is coming back, the back of my right hand worryingly itchy every now and then.

Today is S's and my second wedding anniversary. Late last night we A was tentatively sleeping in the bassinet, S and I reminisced about out favorite memories from the last two years. We remembered hanging out with friends at Sunita bar, concerts in the park, dinners at Dirt Candy and Modern Love, trips to Seattle, Vancouver, Montreal, Boulder. We remembered a night we got particularly drunk at Sunita bar plus drinks later at Dirst Candy, at a time when we were in the desperate midst of fertility treatment and a baby seemed too far away. We found out soon after that S was already pregnant that night.

We realized with a smile last night that all of the memories we were talking about were all from before A. Perhaps we were pining for our lives before. We thought about our favorite A memory until now and for both of us it was whenever A smiled because everything feels right with the world when he does.

## 04/09/19

We had a nice anniversary yesterday. I left work exactly at 5 so I could stop by Cafe Grumpy to pick up coffee ground for a French press for S and a pumpkin bread for the both of us, and still make it back home in time before it got too dark for a walk. we tried out the become gemini carrier for the walk, with A strapped to me. It felt sturdy and A didn't fidget much, especially when I was moving. It required S to help me put it on but I feel after becoming more comfortable with it we could put it on by ourselves.

We walked done Burns Street to the bank on 75th and back. On the walk there A was transfixed by the outside, all new sights for him, at least at that angle. It was I think a preview of A's introduction to the outside world. We are lucky to be his first guides.

S and I made enchiladas that came out incredibly delicious. The sauce we made was a first for us, a green sauce with roasted poblano and jalepeno peppers and tomatilos and might be the best enchilada sauce we have made yet. We filled the enchiladas with kale, black beans, potatoes and jackfruit (leftover from when our friend P came over a few days ago and made us tacos. S and I both ate way too much.

A was pretty calm yesterday. I think now that his dry skin is much better, he is overall less bothered.

## 04/23/19

A had a rough night last night, waking up every two hours which is recently uncharacteristic.

## 04/29/19

A had his worst night in memory last night. his longest stretch of sleep was 2 hours, but some of the stretches were under an hour. In fact I can't remember the last time A had a 5 hour stretch of sleep, it has been at least a couple of weeks. As I have been tracking sleep stretches during the night, I could check.

I'm not sure why A never settled into a long deep sleep last night. He was in a new outfit which does not have sleeves. plus we put him in a made swaddle which left his arms uncovered which maybe kept his arms cold on a chilly night relative to the last week. we tried the regular swaddle in the beginning of the night but A got his arms out fairly quickly, and we decided he has outgrown it. Perhaps we were also out of sync on his feeds and diaper changes, so he was almost always in a state of hunger or dirty diaper. I told S at four in the morning as I was rocking A in my arms trying to get him to sleep knowing that I had to get up for work in three hours with maybe an hour and half worth of sleep in me up to that point that I was never ever doing this again. S is back at work now as well, working Monday through Wednesday as she eases in, so I think she was feeling similarly. S's mother stays with us on the days that S is at work to take care of A and cook and clean for us. She has been absolutely indispensable for us these first months of A's life, and we have depended heavily on her and the rest of our family's and friend's help and support.

One of the things I have been meaning to write about is milk. Recently on my commutes I have been reading or napping as the lack of sleep has hit me and I don't find I have the energy to write. But today I'm pushing myself to as I don't want to leave the diary yet, as there is still many things I want to document.

The reason I want to talk about milk is because it is yet another aspect of S and my new life that requires from us much more planning and consternation than I at least expected. We have been feeding A was only breast milk up to this point (plus however much of the organic cotton he ingests from the socks we put on his hand to keep him from scratching himself and that he keeps jammed in his mouth) and want to continue with that until he is at least one year. So that means that he needs to be fed S's milk whenever he is hungry to his fill, and that S needs to get the milk out almost as regularly to alleviate the pressure of the milk in her body and to keep the milk production up as it will flag if the body gets signals that the milk isn't needed. When S was home, both of these needs would be met when A feed directly from S, but is now often not the case as S is back to work. On A's need to be fed, whoever is caring for him uses a bottle and the major concerns are if he will take the bottle (depending on the bottle itself, the temperature of the milk, his mood etc) and where that milk will come from. For example, milk changes

### 04/30/19

as A grows and his nutritional needs change, so the best milk for him is the most recently pumped. Thus S is continuously pumping A's next day supply is she is going to be working that day, which keeps her tied to A in time and space.

On S's need to pump there are a whole host of logistical concerns. There is the pump itself, a not insignificantly heavy contraption that S needs to lug around with her whereever she goes, and is going with her to MA for a wedding this weekend and to CA for another wedding in a few months. Although paid for by insurance and working reasonably well up to this point, the pump is still a object that we rely heavily on to keep working as a hand pump option we tried has not worked out.

As an interlude, A didn't sleep well last night either, meaning up every hour and a half at the most from 10:30 PM to 3 AM. At that point with S and I at the end of our wits he gave us three hours, and that only after we brought the swaddle back. It is desperately terrible not to get any good stretch of sleep and then have to go to work as I am only half with it standing on the train right now. As we went to bed last night in happier times S came close to convincing me to try for a second, before A reminded me why not.

Back to the milk: then there are the pump parts, a funnel that screws onto a bottle with a round disk piece that fits onto the back of the funnel and a silicone open plug that greets the milk as it moves from the funnel to the bottle. As we have found, all of these pieces are necessary for extracting milk and need to be cleaned between uses. S and I have never been great cleaners and we get lazy so we have backups but we are still constantly having to clean pump parts, and with A's health at stake I worry about becoming too lax about proper cleaning.

And then there is always a question of where to store the milk: outside in the bottle that A drinks from if he will need it soon, or in the fridge where it will last for a day, or in the freezer where it will last for 6 months to a year? We are building up a supply which has already taken up almost three quarters of our freezer and threatens the rest. And S started a pattern of pumping weeks before she was back at work so we had a supply for A in case we needed it: when A is drinking from S directly, we can't tell how much he is drinking, only how long. We have a better idea now that S has been going to work for a few weeks. I think he drinks close to 12 ounces a day.

And in order to keep her supply up, S needs to eat and drink, things she would sometimes forget to do before A. She used to regularly skip breakfast, sometimes not taking anything to work and not eating until dinner. 

## 03/21/21

I'm returning to this diary after almost two years to write about a big change and some nervy times in our lives in the last few days. Much has happened in the last two years of course, A is much bigger, running and climbing and learning and talking, with a big personality and is often a joy to be around. A had been sleeping pretty well in his crib, 9-10 hours a night and about 2 hours in the middle of the day for a nap, until last week.

Last Sunday was daylight savings, spring forward. We were only a little worried about A's schedule, thinking A would adjust pretty quickly. That night, we put him in his crib without too much fuss about an hour before his usual sleep time, but he started crying for us after 15 min or so and it took another 20 min to calm him down enough to go back to sleep in the crib. The first sign of trouble.

On Monday, it seemed he was back to his regular schedule if a little pushed later but on Tuesday and Wednesday he woke up within an hour during his naps, co-sleeping with C for an hour after that. On Thursday was a very short nap with no co-sleeping. That night, A refused to go to the crib, screaming when we tried to take him to his room. We ended up co-sleeping, the first time we had done that in at least half a year. We thought he might be sick, as he felt a little warmer and seem to sneeze and cough a bit more often than usual. On Friday, A climbed out of his crib and shocked S, C and I by walking out of his room as we were trying to decide what to do about this screaming toddler who would not sleep. A climbed out of his crib again that night, and we knew the crib was done. We co-slept again, and the days ahead looked bleak.

Not only did none of us sleep well either night, with A fidgeting and pushing us to the edges, we lost that time when he is sleeping at night in his room that S and I cherised and had grown to depend on. That couple of hours before I went to bed was a mental break from childcare, time to cook and eat dinner and relax with a TV show or movie. Sometimes we would call our friends, or work on other projects around the house or my various coding projects. S would read after I went to sleep. And we needed that time to clean the table, floor and kitchen in an attempt to keep the mice and roaches at bay (with A throwing food everywhere, no small task). This time was immediately taken away from us, and we were devastated.

On Saturday our desperation pushed us to make some big changes in an attempt to get A back to sleeping in his room. I took apart the crib, leaving the mattress on the floor as A's temporary bed until the bed that S ordered that day arrived (expected 3-4 weeks). S organized A's room, moving a playmat, books and chair in to make it more inviting (and moving out a space heater and white noise machine to make it safer). I ordered a baby gate on Amazon with expected arrival Tuesday but S reminded that we might pick it up that day if we get it from Bed Bath and Beyond. I ended up finding the same baby gate from Target to pick up from Queens Place mall, and S picked it up (along with pizza from Screamers!). I installed it that night around 10:00. We got A ready for bed, with a regular bedtime routine consisting of brushing teeth, changing diaper, changing into pajamas, reading books and listening to 'podcasts' (short conversations between the three of us that we record weekly on Sundays), with the big difference that day being that we read and listened to the podcast in A's reimagined room. We talked to A about how he was going to sleep in his room that night, and then made a hasty exit of the room and closed the gate behind us around 10:50 as A was screaming crying. We steeled ourselves for a long night of progressive waiting, planning to first go back to A to reassure him 3 minutes later. But to our complete amazement as we intently watched the monitor's screen, as soon as S closed the door to A's room behind her, A had quietly gone to his bed and was gathering his blanket and sleep toys around him, getting ready to sleep. He did not wake up in the middle of the night as far as we could tell, and slept an extra long 11 hours until 10 the next morning.

We followed Dr. Ferber's methods as laid out in his book Solve your Child's Sleep Problems. The regular bedtime routine and that it takes place in the child's room, gate as boundary, and progressive waiting are all methods prescribed in the book. This is the second time that Dr. Ferber's methods have saved our sanity, the first time being when we first moved A to a crib in his own room after what I remember as months of co-sleeping. The progressive waiting period was definitely longer in that instance and more taxing for all of us emotionally as A cried for us and we had to hold ourselves back from going to him, but still only really lasted one or two nights.

A few things about this episode amaze me. The first is how completely unprepared I felt when A refused to go to the crib. I realized I was taking the time S and I had after A went to sleep for granted, and having it snatched away in the blink of an eye with no sense of how to get it back was disconcerting. The transition of a child from crib to bed is yet another example of an aspect of many if not most parent's and children's lives that caught me by surprise and unprepared for how difficult it would be to endure and overcome. I cannot say the same for S though, she had been researching toddler beds for a while.

I am also amazed by how S and I tranformed A's room, both physically and functionally (as a place we actually spend time with A in now) in a single day. A testament to our teamwork, and the threat of another night of co-sleeping as a motivating factor. And finally I am amazed at how quickly A adapted. How he grows daily is wondrous to see, but for the change from crib to bed I am particularly grateful to A for how speedy it was for the sake of my own sanity.
