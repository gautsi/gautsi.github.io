A had a good night sleeping yesterday: slowly went to bed after an oil massage around midnight, had a diaper change, feed, second diaper change and second feed around 5:30 before going back to sleep through the time I left for work around 8:45. He was starting to rouse as I left.

I have wanted to document in some way my and Ss experiences of As first few weeks for a number of reasons. In particular, multiple people have told us that we will forget how difficult this time has been, generally in response to our wonder at people who choose to do this again. If we choose to have a second child, I want our choice informed by this experience, and I think that perhaps if I describe it here, we can refer to this document to remember. And perhaps A will want to read it too.

As I do feel my memory fading, in the interest of documenting as much of it before it goes, I will not strain to narrate in order but rather will write on what comes to mind and hope the resulting text remains coherent.

Right now I am on a more crowded than usual E train headed home after a more crowded day than usual in Manhattan and at work. I'm thinking now of the ER visit. As first pediatrician's visit was when A was 4 days old, Jan 21 sometime around 3. Being As first trip out of the house since we brought him back from the hospital, S and I were stressed and anxious trying to prepare for all reasonably potential disasters. we packed what we thought was a thorough diaper bag
