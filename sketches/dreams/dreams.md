I invite a bunch of Insight friends to our place, we are playing a game at a long table, eating pizza and we leave S out. She says she is going upstairs and I say yeah, I know. She wonders what about her lunch, as she hasn't eaten yet. She is hurt and annoyed at me.

Doctor's (OB) office, S still pregnant, I left while we were still in the waiting room, for an hour to return video and have lunch with friends. Doctor (female) was just telling me what was happening, not S, S couldn't hear so S was annoyed. Power went out, our appointment wasn't done but I just left. When I came back, S was annoyed at me and I didn't know why. S says you could have been meeting another girl, I make huff noises. S says I don't care, I'll just find another doctor in long island and go to the appointments by myself.

I have a younger brother younger than D, we are visiting Texas and are at his apartment, S is trying to get N to change a flight ticket but she isn't doing it, she tells me to help but I say later, she and younger brother headed to our rented apartment and he tells her you know no one in the family likes you because you are bossy.
