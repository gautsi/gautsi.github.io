Hi, my name is Gautam and I'm a data scientist in New York who loves learning and experimenting with machine learning. In my current non-work projects, I try to visualize learning using [p5.js](https://p5js.org/), [matter.js](http://brm.io/matter-js/) and [tensorflow.js](https://js.tensorflow.org/). I take inspiration from Dan Schiffman's [youtube](https://www.youtube.com/user/shiffman) videos.
